"""This program analyzes stock data and outputs to a webpage 
client wants to track stock data trends from Alpha Vantage website. 
This site offers an api that returns historical stock data from the past 20 years. 
The data is returned in json format. There is no way to visualize the data or choose a date range to view the data. 
The api, by default, returns 20 years of data for all but one of its functions.

This program queries the Alpha Vantage api
This program asks the user to select a date range to view the data, and the type of chart they want to view the data in

This application should: 
#Ask the user to enter the stock symbol for the company they want data for.
#Ask the user for the chart type they would like.
#Ask the user for the time series function they want the api to use.
#Ask the user for the beginning date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
#Ask the user for the end date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
#The end date should not be before the begin date
#Generate a graph and open in the userâ€™s default browser.
